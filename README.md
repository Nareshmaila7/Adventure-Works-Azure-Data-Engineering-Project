# **Adventure-Works-Azure-Data-Engineering-Project-Data With Medallion Architecture**

This repository showcases an end-to-end Azure Data Engineering project where the Medallion Architecture is implemented for processing and transforming adventure sales data. It demonstrates the use of Azure services like Data Factory, Databricks, and Data Lake Gen 2 to build a scalable data pipeline.

The project involves creating a clean data pipeline from raw data ingestion to transformation and analysis-ready datasets. The repository contains the implementation, data transformation notebooks, SQL scripts, and architecture diagrams.

## **Architecture Diagram**  
Below is the architecture diagram illustrating the flow of data through the Medallion Architecture.
